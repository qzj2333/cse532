Overview:

Wrapper Facades:

Observations & Questions:
1. We saw some lines has a whitespace at begining of the line and we use trim() to get rid of them.
2. Use Condition Variables make sure the lines print out in the right order, so that we don't need to sort the vector before print as we did in lab0.
3. We use shared_ptr for input file stream in order to get the actual file, and did not use reference for string ?????????????
